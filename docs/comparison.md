# How Agentic-DART Compares to Existing DFIR Tooling

This is the document a reviewer should read before asking "why not just
use Velociraptor?" Agentic-DART is not a replacement for any of the tools
below — it sits at a different layer of the stack.

Agentic-DART does not replace any of the lower layers. It orchestrates them.

## Side-by-side

| Tool | Layer | Primary actor | Guardrail model |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Velociraptor | Collection / query | Human analyst writes VQL | Role-based access |
| KAPE | Triage | Human analyst runs target set | File system scope |
| Timesketch | Visualization | Human analyst explores timeline | N/A |
| GRR | Remote live forensics | Human operator | Role-based access |
| Plaso (log2timeline) | Timeline construction | Human / script | N/A |
| Sigma rules | Detection logic | SIEM/EDR engines | N/A |
| **Protocol SIFT (baseline)** | AI orchestration | AI agent (prompted) | **Prompt-based** |
| **Agentic-DART** | AI orchestration | AI agent (architectural) | **Architectural (typed MCP surface)** |

## The Agentic-DART thesis — where it differs from Protocol SIFT

Protocol SIFT and Agentic-DART share the top-layer category (AI agent on
SIFT). The difference is how guardrails are enforced:

| Concern | Protocol SIFT (baseline) | Agentic-DART |
|---|---|---|
| Destructive commands | Agent is told not to | Function does not exist on the server |
| Evidence modification | Prompt-based "please don't" | `mount -o ro,noload` + no write function in registry |
| Path traversal | Prompt-based | `_safe_resolve` — architectural |
| Audit trail | Log of LLM turns | SHA-256-chained JSONL, trace-queryable |
| Self-correction | Best-effort prompting | Playbook-forced, `progress.jsonl` state |
| Accuracy measurement | N/A by default | `scripts/measure_accuracy.py`, committed numbers |

This is the contribution Agentic-DART tries to make to the FIND EVIL!
community: move the defender's analog of Anthropic's GTG-1002
architecture from prompt-obedience to architectural-enforcement.

## Things Agentic-DART is NOT trying to be

- It is **not** a Velociraptor replacement. Velociraptor collects; Agentic-DART reasons.
- It is **not** a Sigma engine replacement. Agentic-DART's `match_sigma_rules`
  is a subset implementation for the agent's own triage needs, not a
  production SIEM detection engine.
- It is **not** a Timesketch alternative. It builds timelines for the
  agent to reason on, not for human visual exploration.
- It is **not** a production IR platform yet. It is a hackathon
  submission that demonstrates an architectural thesis and provides a
  working MVP to build on.

## When to use Agentic-DART vs. when to use something else

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Collect artifacts from 10,000 endpoints | Velociraptor |
| Triage a single workstation via live flash drive | KAPE |
| Visualize a multi-host timeline with a team | Timesketch / Plaso |
| Run an autonomous AI triage of a disk image with an architectural safety guarantee | **Agentic-DART** |
| Detect known attack patterns from Sigma rules at SIEM scale | Splunk / Elastic / Chronicle |
| Have an AI senior-analyst-style loop produce a courtroom-traceable report | **Agentic-DART** |

The two use cases where Agentic-DART is the right answer are the ones above
in bold. For everything else, reach for the tool that was built for
that job, and consider Agentic-DART as the layer that can orchestrate those
tools under a safety-enforced agent loop.
