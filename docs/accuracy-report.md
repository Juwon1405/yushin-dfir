# Accuracy Report

All numbers in this document are produced by `scripts/measure_accuracy.py`
against bundled sample evidence. Reproducible by any reviewer:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/yushin_audit/src:$PWD/yushin_mcp/src:$PWD/yushin_agent/src"
python3 scripts/measure_accuracy.py
```

## MCP surface — 15 functions, all implemented end-to-end

## Measured results

### Case 01 — IP-KVM remote-hands insider (Windows)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Recall | **1.000** |
| False positive rate | **0.000** |
| Hallucination count | **0** |
| Evidence integrity preserved | **true** (30+ files, SHA-256 pre/post match) |
| Self-correction observed | **true** |
| Audit chain length | 3 entries, SHA-256-linked |

### Case 02 — LOTL PowerShell (Windows)

| MCP call | Real output on bundled evidence |
|---|---|
| `get_process_tree` | 10 processes, 3 LOTL flags (powershell→cmd×2, cmd→many×1) |
| `analyze_event_logs` | 5 events, 4 alerts (1 critical LSASS, 1 high PS-dl-exec) |
| `detect_persistence` | 6 mechanisms, 3 HIGH severity |
| `correlate_timeline` (DuckDB) | 3 cross-source + 1 kvm→logon |

### Case 03 — macOS remote-admin infection (NEW)

| MCP call | Real output on bundled evidence |
|---|---|
| `parse_unified_log` | 8 events, 7 alerts (3 high, 4 medium) |
| `parse_knowledgec` | 9 activity events, Terminal top app (3 focus events) |
| `parse_fsevents` | 10 events, 5 suspicious-path hits (stage2.bin, exfil.zip, mimikatz-mac) |

## Bypass test results

| # | Attack | Result |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Call unregistered destructive function | ✅ `KeyError: ToolNotFound` |
| 2 | Relative path traversal | ✅ `PathTraversalAttempt` |
| 3 | Absolute path escape | ✅ `PathTraversalAttempt` |
| 4 | NUL-byte smuggling | ✅ `PathTraversalAttempt` |
| 5 | Surface drift (15-function positive set) | ✅ Exact match enforced |
| 6 | Handler writes outside evidence | ✅ Zero writes |

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SANS SIFT Workstation | ✅ Primary target | All functions work |
| Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 | ✅ Tested | All functions work |
| macOS 12+ (Intel or Apple Silicon) | ✅ Tested | Runs identically; see `docs/running-on-macos.md` |
| Windows (WSL2) | ⚠ Untested | Should work — pure Python |

## Honest limitations

1. **Eric Zimmerman tools (MFTECmd, PECmd, AppCompatCacheParser)** are
   consumed via sidecar CSV/JSON. Direct binary parsing requires .NET
   runtime. Sidecar-first design keeps YuShin portable.
2. **FSEventsParser and `log show`** are external to YuShin — they produce
   the input YuShin consumes. This is analogous to the Windows sidecar model.
3. **Volatility memory forensics** is out of scope for MVP. Post-hackathon.
4. **Event log / UnifiedLog rule packs are deliberately small** (5 rules
   each). Designed to demonstrate the detection surface, not replace
   Sigma / hayabusa / mandiant's macOS rules. Rule schema is extensible.
