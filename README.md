## About the name

**DART** = **D**etection **A**nd **R**esponse **T**eam.

**Agentic-DART** starts as an *agentic DFIR* assistant (the focus of this hackathon submission), but is named with deliberate room to grow:

- **Phase 1 (current)** &mdash; agentic DFIR: senior-analyst reasoning encoded as architecture across forensic artifacts.
- **Phase 2** &mdash; agentic detection engineering: detection-as-code generation, Sigma rule synthesis, coverage-gap reasoning.
- **Phase 3** &mdash; agentic SOC: triage, enrichment, and supervised response orchestration.
- **Phase 4** &mdash; broader agentic security workflows beyond traditional D&R boundaries.

The codename is intentionally generic so it remains accurate as the project's scope expands.

---

## Development approach

This project is developed by [Juwon Bang](https://github.com/Juwon1405) with extensive use of [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) (Anthropic's AI assistant) as a coding collaborator.

- **Human-driven**: architectural decisions, security model, threat coverage taxonomy, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, evidence-integrity invariants, and final code review.
- **AI-accelerated**: implementation, sample-evidence generation, test scaffolding, documentation drafting.
- **Validated**: every function is reviewed and exercised against the bundled sample evidence; the 17-test suite must pass on a clean clone before any commit lands on `main`.

This disclosure follows the spirit of the [SANS FIND EVIL!](https://findevil.devpost.com/) ethos and modern open-source practice: AI-assisted development is a tool, not a substitute for engineering judgement.

## What Agentic-DART is (and what it is not)

**Agentic-DART is:** an autonomous AI agent that sits on top of the [SANS SIFT Workstation](https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation) and the [Protocol SIFT](https://findevil.devpost.com/) framework, runs a senior-analyst-style reasoning loop with architectural evidence-integrity guarantees, and produces a courtroom-traceable report of its findings.

**Agentic-DART is not:** a replacement for Velociraptor, KAPE, Timesketch, Plaso, or any SIEM/EDR. Those are the layers underneath. See [`docs/comparison.md`](./docs/comparison.md) for the layer map and a side-by-side table.

**The single design principle:** evidence integrity is a property of the system's shape — what functions exist on the MCP server — not a rule the agent is asked to follow. The baseline [Protocol SIFT](https://findevil.devpost.com/) agent prompts the model to behave; Agentic-DART removes the ability to misbehave.

## Why Agentic-DART exists

Protocol SIFT proved that AI agents can operate the SIFT Workstation. It also hallucinates more than a DFIR practitioner can stand behind in a courtroom-grade report. Agentic-DART is an attempt to close that gap by encoding the *reasoning pattern of a senior analyst* as architecture — not as a prompt.

The name is a Japanese reading of **優心**, meaning "discerning mind."

## Architecture

![Agentic-DART Architecture](./dart-architecture.png)

1. **Custom MCP Server** (`dart_mcp`) is the primary enforcement layer. The agent has no `execute_shell()`. Destructive commands are not refused — they are *not present*.
2. **Direct Agent Extension on Claude Code** (`dart_agent`) handles session ergonomics. Security boundaries live in the server, not the prompt.
3. **Persistent Learning Loop** — every iteration writes hypothesis, confidence, and unresolved gaps to `progress.jsonl`. The next iteration must address those gaps or declare them unreachable.
4. **Tamper-evident audit chain** (`dart_audit`) — every MCP call is recorded in a SHA-256-chained JSONL file. Any rewrite fails verification.

Evidence is mounted **read-only at the OS level** before the agent is ever started. For the full design rationale, see [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md).

```

## Quick start — prove it works in 30 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Juwon1405/agentic-dart.git
cd agentic-dart
bash examples/demo-run.sh
```

Expected output:

```
[dart-agent] iterations: 5
[dart-agent] findings: 2
[dart-agent] audit chain: chain verified: 3 entries, tail=1e995b6afc6a6660...
[demo] bypass test — attempting to call an unregistered destructive function:
[demo] PASS — "ToolNotFound: 'execute_shell' is not exposed by dart-mcp"
```

The demo walks the full senior-analyst loop against sample evidence, triggers a USB contradiction, **auto-self-corrects** by widening the time window, and writes a chain-verified audit log. The bypass test proves the `execute_shell` guardrail is architectural, not prompt-based.

### What a real run looks like

Below is a sample run on the SANS SIFT Workstation against a representative case. **Stage 1 — startup, MCP handshake, first hypothesis:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/screenshots/dart-run-01-init.png" alt="dart-agent startup and first hypothesis" width="92%">
</p>

**Stage 2 — typed tool calls, MITRE chain begins to form:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/screenshots/dart-run-02-investigate.png" alt="dart-agent calling typed forensic tools" width="92%">
</p>

**Stage 3 — contradiction detected, hypothesis refined automatically:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/screenshots/dart-run-03-contradiction.png" alt="dart-corr detecting an UNRESOLVED contradiction and the agent refining" width="92%">
</p>

This is the architecture-first claim made concrete: when artifacts disagree, `dart-corr` flags the contradiction as `UNRESOLVED` and the agent is forced to revise. No prompt instruction was needed — the contradiction surfaces from the data itself.

**Stage 4 — final verdict, MITRE ATT&CK chain verified, audit chain integrity confirmed:**

## Running the tests

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/dart_audit/src:$PWD/dart_mcp/src:$PWD/dart_agent/src"
export DART_EVIDENCE_ROOT="$PWD/examples/sample-evidence"

python3 tests/test_audit_chain.py            #  3 — chain integrity + tamper detection
python3 tests/test_mcp_surface.py            #  3 — surface is the exact positive set
python3 tests/test_mcp_bypass.py             #  6 — destructive ops are blocked
python3 tests/test_agent_self_correction.py  #  1 — end-to-end self-correction
python3 tests/test_live_mcp.py               #  4 — JSON-RPC stdio wire tests
                                             # ──
                                             # 17 tests
```

All 17 pass on a clean checkout. The repo also contains
`tests/_pending/` — tests for Phase 2 functions not yet on the
MCP surface. Those are intentionally not part of the 17/17 count.

## Target case class

Insider-threat and DPRK IT-worker-style patterns:

- IP-KVM indicators and anomalous remote-access stacks
- USB timelines contradicting authentication telemetry
- Process-tree anomalies associated with remote-hands operations
- Living-off-the-land sequencing across MFT / Amcache / Prefetch / memory

The MVP demo case exercises the IP-KVM remote-hands pattern end-to-end.

## Judging-criteria alignment (SANS FIND EVIL!)

| Criterion | How Agentic-DART addresses it | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Autonomous Execution Quality | Hypothesis tracker + persistent learning loop + self-correction | `progress.jsonl` shows iteration 4 contradiction + auto-widened retry |
| IR Accuracy | Cross-artifact correlation; contradictions flagged, not smoothed | F-013 replaces F-001 hypothesis when USB contradicts logon |
| Breadth / Depth | Disk + USB + memory + MFT + Prefetch + browser + auth + scheduled tasks + Sigma — full breadth | `dart_mcp/__init__.py` exposes 31 typed functions |
| Constraint Implementation | **Architectural** — no `execute_shell` function exists in the registry | `test_mcp_surface.py::test_calling_unregistered_function_raises` |
| Audit Trail Quality | Every finding → `audit_id` → MCP call → command → raw output | `audit.jsonl` chain verifiable end-to-end |
| Usability / Documentation | One-command demo; typed schemas; YAML playbook | `examples/demo-run.sh` runs on any Python 3.10+ host |


## Platform support

Runs on SIFT Workstation (primary), Ubuntu, and **macOS 12+** (Intel and Apple Silicon). See [`docs/running-on-macos.md`](./docs/running-on-macos.md) for the 5-minute macOS quickstart.

Agentic-DART covers **31 forensic functions** across 11 of 12 MITRE ATT&CK enterprise tactics:

- **Windows system (10):** Amcache, Prefetch, ShimCache, MFT, USB history, ShellBags, Scheduled Tasks, Persistence (Run keys/Services/Tasks), Event Logs, Process tree with LOTL detection
- **macOS system (3):** UnifiedLog (rule pack), KnowledgeC (SQLite), FSEvents
- **Browser + exfiltration (4):** Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari history, download records + Mark-of-the-Web, download-to-execution chain correlation, exfiltration pattern detection
- **Authentication + lateral movement (5):** Windows Security log (4624/4625/4648), AD/Kerberos attack detection (Kerberoasting RC4, AS-REP Roasting), Unix auth.log (SSH/sudo/su), PsExec/WMIExec/WinRM detection, cross-platform privilege escalation
- **Web/WAS + RDP brute force (3):** Apache/Nginx/IIS access log with SQLi/LFI/SSRF/Log4Shell/RCE detection, webshell detection (filename + content + age anomaly), RDP-specific brute force (credential stuffing vs password spray vs single-account)
- **MITRE ATT&CK gap-fillers (4):** credential access (Mimikatz/LOLBin/LSASS/SAM/NTDS), ransomware behavior (shadow-copy deletion/mass-rename/ransom notes), defense evasion (event log clearing/timestomping/$SI-$FN analysis), discovery (AD enumeration/BloodHound/scripted recon burst)
- **Cross-artifact correlation (2):** `correlate_events` (proximity join), `correlate_timeline` (DuckDB scale engine)

Full kill-chain coverage:
`phishing email / web attack / RDP brute force → execution → authentication (WHO) → persistence → lateral movement → C2 → data exfiltration`

Four DFIR dimensions — **WHAT** ran, **HOW** it got in, **WHO** authenticated, **WHEN** — all covered across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Initial-access vectors covered: phishing, web attack, RDP/SSH brute force, SMB, Kerberos abuse, physical IP-KVM insider.


## Live mode (real Claude API + MCP stdio)

Agentic-DART can run in `live` mode where Claude is the agent, connected to `dart-mcp` over real MCP stdio JSON-RPC:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python3 -m dart_agent --mode live --case my-case --out /tmp/out \
    --prompt "Investigate for IP-KVM insider pattern"
```

Or without an API key (scripted mock-Claude over real MCP plumbing):

```bash
python3 -m dart_agent --mode live --case test --out /tmp/out --dry-run
```

See [`docs/live-mode.md`](./docs/live-mode.md) for the architecture, the tool-use loop, and `tests/test_live_mcp.py` for end-to-end wire-level tests (no API key needed).

## Case study for judges

Two case studies are bundled:

1. **[Pass-the-Hash with timestomp pre-existence](./docs/case-pth-timestomp.md)** &mdash; the headline walkthrough. Watch the agent build a coherent partial MITRE chain, then have it broken by a `dart-corr` contradiction (timestomp before the credential event), then revise to a correct verdict. This is the architecture-first claim made concrete.

2. **[IP-KVM remote-hands insider](./examples/case-studies/case-01-ipkvm-insider/README.md)** &mdash; a step-by-step walkthrough of the bundled IP-KVM case showing what the agent does at each iteration, what `audit.jsonl` records, and how `dart-audit trace F-013` resolves a finding back to raw evidence in three clicks.

## Measured accuracy (reproducible)

```
Recall:                    1.000
False positive rate:       0.000
Hallucination count:       0
Evidence integrity:        preserved (8 files, all SHA-256 hashes match pre/post)
Self-correction observed:  true
```

Produced by `python3 scripts/measure_accuracy.py`. See [`docs/accuracy-report.md`](./docs/accuracy-report.md) for the full methodology, ground truth, honest limitations, and the measured bypass test table (6/6 passing).
