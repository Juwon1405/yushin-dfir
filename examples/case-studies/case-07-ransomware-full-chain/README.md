# Case Study 07 — Full Ransomware Chain (MITRE ATT&CK Coverage)

**Scenario class:** Post-foothold ransomware deployment with full MITRE
**Evidence:** bundled at `examples/sample-evidence/disk/` (creds-processes, discovery-processes, security-events, log-clearing-events)
**Functions used:** `detect_credential_access`, `detect_discovery`,
  `detect_defense_evasion`, `detect_ransomware_behavior`
**Reproduce:** Case 01 ships in the bundled demo; Case 07 is exercised by direct MCP invocation. See "How to invoke" at the end of this page.

## Why this case matters

Cases 01-06 covered initial access and lateral movement. This case
covers what attackers do AFTER the foothold — the "hands on keyboard"
phase. Research sources (The DFIR Report 2025, Red Canary 2025,
Mandiant M-Trends 2026) agree that 80%+ of modern intrusions end in
one of three outcomes:

1. **Credential access** (T1003) — steal domain creds for deeper access
2. **Ransomware** (T1486, T1489, T1490) — encrypt for extortion
3. **Covering tracks** (T1070) — clear logs, timestomp

Agentic-DART now detects all three across ~30 MITRE sub-techniques.

## Final incident narrative

> At 15:00 UTC, the adversary began post-foothold activity with a recon
> burst — `whoami /all` followed by 11 discovery commands in 60 seconds
> (net user /domain, nltest, systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, arp, and
> SharpHound collection of the full AD graph). This is characteristic
> of a scripted attack framework, not human keyboard interaction.
>
> At 15:01, the operator executed Mimikatz (`sekurlsa::logonpasswords`)
> followed by procdump of LSASS. They then exfiltrated the SAM,
> SECURITY, and SYSTEM registry hives for offline hash extraction, and
> ran `ntdsutil ac in ntds ifm create` to dump the entire Active
> Directory database. As an anti-forensic cover, they also used the
> `comsvcs.dll MiniDump` LOLBin technique.
>
> At 14:30 (backdated — see timestomp analysis), the operator deployed
> ransomware. Anti-recovery commands ran first: vssadmin deleted all
> volume shadow copies, wbadmin cleared the backup catalog, bcdedit
> disabled Windows Recovery. Then 15 taskkill/net stop commands
> terminated SQL servers, Defender (MsMpEng.exe), Veeam, and BackupExec
> within 10 seconds. wevtutil cleared Security, System, and Application
> event logs; the resulting 1102 clear-event itself was the only entry
> remaining.
>
> At 14:31, 30 documents were renamed with the `.locked` extension.
> At 14:32, ransom notes (`readme.txt`, `decrypt_instructions.txt`)
> appeared in user directories.
>
> Findings F-071 through F-089 reference the audit entries across
> credential access (T1003.×), discovery (T1087/T1069/T1482/T1018),
> defense evasion (T1070.001), and impact (T1486/T1489/T1490).

## How to invoke this case directly

```bash
# From the repo root
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/dart_audit/src:$PWD/dart_mcp/src"
export DART_EVIDENCE_ROOT="$PWD/examples/sample-evidence"

python3 - <<'PY'
from dart_mcp import call_tool

result = call_tool('detect_credential_access', {})
print('detect_credential_access', '→', len(result.get('findings', [])), 'findings,', result.get('audit_id', 'no-audit-id')[:24])

result = call_tool('detect_discovery', {})
print('detect_discovery', '→', len(result.get('findings', [])), 'findings,', result.get('audit_id', 'no-audit-id')[:24])

result = call_tool('detect_defense_evasion', {})
print('detect_defense_evasion', '→', len(result.get('findings', [])), 'findings,', result.get('audit_id', 'no-audit-id')[:24])
PY
```

Each call returns a typed dict with `findings` (list of MITRE-tagged signals), `audit_id` (SHA-256-chained), and source-file metadata. See [accuracy-report.md](../../docs/accuracy-report.md) for measured recall/FPR numbers.
